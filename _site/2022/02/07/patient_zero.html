    <p>When the virus appeared, people didn’t care so much. They thought it would be an isolated case. There was hypocritical empathy in the air; <em>it will not leave that continent</em>. People would question facts all the time. The price of technological progress. Distorted information. Conversations about anarchy. Racism. Xenophobia. Things started to take a dark turn when the first cases were reported on other continents.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that transmission occurs through contact with infected saliva or blood. Initial symptoms are the common symptoms of a strong infection. High fever, body aches. The final stages include dementia, possible anxiety attacks, and tantrums. Death in two weeks.</p>

<p>Great pyres were burning countless bodies in the open air. Curfews have become lockdowns. People avoided going out on the streets, and those who did were often violent and looting. People who had slowly stocked up on supplies had to venture out into the streets to restock. Gradually, pilgrimage became usual.</p>

<p>Phillipe saw his big luck when he heard the message on the radio. “Research center seeks volunteers to study a vaccine.” Phillipe knew his contribution would be vital. His certainty that his organism was immune came from an event where his infection seemed inevitable. Phillipe wanted to help the world. Phillipe wanted his blood to be studied so that a vaccine would be a reality.</p>

<p>But Phillipe was wrong.</p>

<p>What started with quizzes and light studies became torture. Patients died as men in lab coats tested different pathogens. Phillipe realized too late that the scientists didn’t want a cure; they just wanted to control the virus. Control the population.</p>

<p>That was the last lucid thought of Phillipe who, strapped to a stretcher, had been injected with an aggressive version of the virus. Not even his body could contain the infection. Tears streamed down his expressionless face as his thoughts clouded to the point where Phillipe no longer had any discernment.</p>

<p>Just one feeling. An insatiable feeling. A will that, for a human being, seems surreal or unhealthy. Hunger. Meat hunger. Hunger for human flesh.</p>
