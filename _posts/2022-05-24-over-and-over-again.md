excerpt: "Ken woke up. But should he?"
---

<div style="text-align:center;">1</div>

He woke up. Ken, 14, noticed that everything seemed darker than usual. Maybe the weather was not good. It should have been enough for him to realize something was amiss. His cousin was not in his bed. Ken had been living with his aunt and uncle for three months now.

The apartment was small. Ken got up and dragged himself to get something to eat. He had to get ready for school soon.

The kitchen was next to the living room. If you came through the corridor, you could not see the living room to your right until you were out of such small passageway. Ken was about to enter the living room when his aunt crossed his path doing somersaults. *What the f-*

<div style="text-align:center;">2</div>

Ken woke up. His heart was racing a little. *Fucking dream.*

He saw his cousin was still in his bed. His cousin always woke up way after Ken.

Ken walked with a bit of caution through the corridor. The TV was on. His uncle was on the couch, eating what seemed like strawberries? He heard his aunt in the kitchen. She was chopping her own fingers, and her mouth was dirty with blood. She smiled at Ken. "Do you want some too, you little fucker?!"

Ken got up from the bed. With caution, he saw that the living room and the kitchen were empty. He checked on his cousin; he was sleeping. He tried to wake him up, but his cousin just grunted to leave him be.

Quite relieved, maybe, Ken went to the kitchen. He grabbed some snacks. He ate. He got ready for school. His cousin didn't wake up, but that wasn't the first time he would skip class. When Ken opened the door to leave, he saw his house was floating in the void. He almost fell.

The demon was laughing hard at a skinny, malnourished man, stretched up in the air in chains. A grown-up Ken had his eyes wide open, bleeding in horror and disbelief. 

<div style="text-align:center;">5</div>

Ken woke up. He rushed to his uncle's room. They were sleeping with grim smiles on their faces. With their eyes shut, they turned their heads as if watching Ken.

He grabbed his uncle's gun. He pressed the gun on his chin.

<div style="text-align:center;">6</div>

Ken woke up no more.
