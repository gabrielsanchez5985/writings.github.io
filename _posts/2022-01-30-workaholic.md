*Another half hour and it's over*. I thought on a typical Friday. The thought of just another low-to-middle-class worker.

I prepared to leave. Same for the people who work with me at a large table. The long awaited weekend. It is there every week, but we always crave it.

Enough time to barely breathe the air we call pure. The meetings were crazy that Monday. I closed my agenda on purpose to avoid more meetings. Performance depends on pro-activity.

Another weekend. And another. And one more. I just noticed something wrong when I saw my fingers while typing in my office. A mark of what looked like a ring. A wedding ring?

Wedding seemed distant to me. How could I have time for marriage with so much work? A CEO needs focus. Meeting now; I’ll think about it later.

I didn't even see my life go by. Work took over me, I didn't even see my marriage fall apart; in fact, I didn't even see my marriage. Was there a wedding?

I tried to look outside. Oh well, there is no “outside,” just a fake window with a nice picture to avoid distractions. 

“Reschedule all meetings for Monday. It's okay, yeah, don't worry.”

I'll try to take more care of myself. I left the building.

Rearranging the Friday meetings seemed dumb when I saw the agenda for today, but at least I enjoyed the weekend. I don't really remember. I don't remember much outside of work. I don't remember anything but work.

I tried to stay calm as I walked to the exit. I saw some people looking.

Tuesday was killing me. Leaving early yesterday accumulated a lot of things. Wait. I went out yesterday and what did I do? Desperate, I hurried to the exit. Everyone looked at me standing up.

The doorman was smiling. A strange smile.

“Leaving early again, sir?” he said. “You seem to be looking for something.”

He didn't open the main door. I ordered him to open the gate. His crooked smile freaked me out.

“Your life is here.”

Reality took me like a club to the head. Distorted memories of a life wasted dedicating myself to work. The contacts I accumulated as I moved up the company and the people who disappeared as I was always unavailable. My wife, my daughter, my true friends.

My death by heart attack. In my office chair, of course. An inevitable fate for someone whose stress was a constant.

I was dead. I died from working too hard.

Absolute fear overwhelmed me with the last line I remember from the doorman.
"Nothing fairer than eternity in the environment you love most, sir."

(...)

Another half hour and it's over. I thought on a typical Friday. Another half hour for me to enjoy a well-deserved weekend for a low to middle class worker. The day flew by.

The doorman was strange today, though.

“Welcome once more,” he said with a grim smile.
