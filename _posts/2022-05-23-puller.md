excerpt: "Something is pulling his blankets from under the bed."
---

The young lad was having a hard time getting some sleep. A few nights ago, he was sleeping just fine when, *he is pretty sure*, something pulled his blankets. It wasn't a strong pull, but enough for him to stay awake the rest of the night. Two nights ago, something pulled down the arm he left dangling outside the bed. That was enough to prompt him to sleep in the couch.

But even that was not enough. Not because something is pulling stuff from under the couch too. He can hear something scratching the bed in his bedroom.

He found a new place to stay. Didn't even search long; anything is better than that damned apartment.

When he went to sleep again, longing for a good night of sleep, he heard something scratching under the bed again.

Out of insane fear, he leaned over to see what was under the bed. He was not sure if he wanted to find something to prove that he wasn't going crazy.

Nothing. But then two legs appeard on the other side of the bed. Behind him. A sound like a muffled laugh made him look.

And his mind didn't have enough time to register what he saw. He was pulled to the void.
