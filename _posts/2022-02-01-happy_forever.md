excerpt: "Jack's decent into madness."
---

At first, Jack tried to avoid those thoughts. *Ungodly*. But eventually, Jack succumbed to them. Having a gun at home makes so much sense now.

There was no particular night. Jack just waited for the signal. His family perhaps noticed something eerie, but a couple *nothing, babe, I'm good* was enough to dismiss any suspicion.

The signal came on a regular night. A very quiet night. Jack got out of bed; prepared the gun. *Make it swift. Make it painless.* *Bang!* One to the head. His other daughter woke up lost. She only had enough time to wonder. *Bang!*

"Jack! Where are you!?" Ann said. 

Jack's wife didn't want to believe that at first. When she saw him with the gun at hand, she had enough time to scream. *Bang!*

"I killed them!" Jack said. He started repeating himself in tears with a hysterical laugh. People in white burst into Jack's cushioned room. Syringes at hand. He pushed them off, but during his screams, they were able to drug him.

"There is no other way, ma'am. We tried everything we could. I know, I know. The procedure is painless, ma'am. Trust me, after the procedure, Jack will be happy forever. He is scheduled for tomorrow."
